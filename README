works.  may change.


# intro

wm/run is an alternative to wm/sh.  it accepts commands that it
executes by sh(1).  wm/run is different from wm/sh in the following
respects:

- it doesn't pretend i/o of the shell, and programs started by the
  shell, are part of the same textsoup.  instead, it keeps the i/o
  (internally) separate and lets you navigate earlier commands and their
  i/o.
- Del kills the program currently running
- file name completion with tab
- vi-like command-line editing and history (similar to openbsd's pdksh)
- different colors for commands, input and output


# install

change the "mkconfig" if you do not have $ROOT set.  now "mk install"
to compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- chording for text widgets?
- indicate somewhere that partial utf-8 characters are lingering?
- more ^x shortcut for text in text widgets?
- keys for resizing the focused text widget?
- button3-drag for plumb?
- provide keys for inserting all completion matches?
- there should be a way to type multi-line text.  e.g. by starting a vixen.
- for now, there won't be a way to run multiple programs concurrently.
- think of something for /dev/cons & /dev/consctl.
