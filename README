works, may grow a few features.


# intro

wm/run is an alternative to wm/sh.  wm/run uses the inferno shell
to execute commands.  wm/run has the following features that wm/sh
does not have:

- input history (both commands and stdin), with up/down navigation
- Del kills the running program
- file name completion with tab
- show std in,out,err and exceptions differently
- vi-like command-line editing

just as wm/sh, wm/run also does chording & plumbing.


# install

change the "mkconfig" if you do not have $ROOT set.  now "mk install"
to compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.


# latest version

the latest version can be found at:

    http://www.ueber.net/code/r/wmrun


# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net.


# todo

- indicate somewhere that partial utf-8 characters are lingering?
- implement split stdin/stderr again?
- when plumbing of text, use the directory the command finished in?  need a way to determine the dir.
