works.  may change.


# intro

wm/run is an alternative to wm/sh.  it accepts commands that it
executes by sh(1).  wm/run is different from wm/sh in the following
respects:

- it doesn't pretend i/o of the shell, and programs started by the
  shell, are part of the same textsoup.  instead, it keeps the i/o
  (internally) separate and lets you navigate earlier commands and their
  i/o.
- Del kills the program currently running
- file name completion with tab
- vi-like command-line editing and history (similar to openbsd's pdksh)
- different colors for commands, input and output


# install

change the "mkconfig" if you do not have $ROOT set.  now "mk install"
to compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- put line after successful plumb with "^x p" in history
- history for command input (stdin)
- make a var that holds all command i/o, so don't only keep it per command.  needed for redrawing with showhist (when i/o from previously running command comes in).  also clarify in man page that one program can read stdin (the latest), but that the others can still run in the background and write to their stdout & stderr.
- provide keys for inserting all completion matches?
- indicate somewhere that partial utf-8 characters are lingering?
- more/less ^x shortcuts for text in text widgets?
- keys for resizing the focused text widget?
- for now, there won't be a way to run multiple programs concurrently.
- think of something for /dev/cons & /dev/consctl.
