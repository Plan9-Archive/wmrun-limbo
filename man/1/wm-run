.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wm/run

.B -d

.B -123Chi

.I cmd
.I ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wm/run
runs commands and displays the output.
It is similar to
.IR wm-sh (1)
but with several distinctive features:
.IP \(bu
The standard input, output and error, and commands and exit codes are recorded separately, not as a single type of text.
Commands and their i/o can be displayed in several views.
.IP \(bu
.L Del
kills the currently running command.
.IP \(bu
File name completion with the tab key.
.IP \(bu
Vi-like command-line and input editing.
.IP \(bu
Directory and file navigation with mouse and key bindings.

.SS Options:
If
.I cmd
is given on the command-line, it is executed as first command.
Otherwise
.L lc
is executed to compactly display the files in the current working directory.

.TP
.B -d
Enable debug prints.
.TP
.B -123
Set the
.I splitmode
to 1, 2 or 3.
Can also be set at runtime through the
.LR "^x [123]"
commands.
.TP
.B -C
Do not show colors in output.
Also see command
.LR "^x c" .
.TP
.B -h
Show multiple commands (`history') at a time.
Also see
.LR "^x h" .
.TP
.B -i
Show the input text widget.
Also see
.LR "^x i" .

.I Wm/run
shows an input entry at the bottom of its window, in which the user may enter a new command or input for a running command.
To the left of the input is a small rectangle, the color of which indicates what will happen with the input:
.TP
.I gray
No command is running, a new command will be started.
.TP
.I green
A command is running, no reads (by the program) on standard input are pending, no writes (to the program, by
.IR wm/run )
are pending.
.TP
.I blue
Only one or more reads from the program are pending, no writes.
.TP
.I red
Only one or more writes to the program are pending, no reads from the program.
Note that it is not possible to have both pending reads and pending writes.
.PP
Above the input entry is a line containing various bits of status information:  the current
.I splitmode
(numeric),
whether stdin is shown (`i'), whether multiple commands are shown (`h') or only the current, whether text is printed in color (`c'),
whether the command still holds references stdin/stdout/stderr, status and sequence number of the command, and the command itself.
Above that are one or more text areas displaying the stdin, stdout and stderr.
.PP
.I Wm/run
starts with a single text area that contains both stdout and stderr, with text from stderr displayed in orange.
Stdin is hidden by default, but visibility can be toggled with
.LR "^x i"
or by clicking the
.LR `i' .
This view mode is called
.IR "splitmode 2" .
.I "Splitmode 1"
has a single text area with stdin, stdout and stderr in it.
.I "Splitmode 3"
has a text area for each of stdin, stdout, and stderr (with the possibility to hide stdin).
The mode can be set by the command-line options
.BR -123
and with
.LR "^x [123]" ,
or cycled through by clicking the
.I splitmode
number.
.PP
Several keyboard shortcuts, such as page up and down, operate on the
.IR "selected text area" .
The non-selected text areas are indicated by a black scroll bar.
The selected text area also contains the
.IR "text selection" :
either the text selected by the mouse, or all text in case of no selection.
.PP
Each type of text is shown in a different color (on a black background):
blue for stdin, white for stdout, orange for stderr, green for commands, a yellow
.L ok
for successful completion and non-successful exit statuses in red.
Displaying colors can be disabled at startup by
.B -C
or toggled at runtime by
.LR "^x c"
or clicking the
.LR `c' .
.PP
.I Wm/run
only shows one command at a time by default:  before starting a new command, text areas are cleared.
In this mode only stdin, stdout and stderr is shown in the text area's, commands and statuses can only be found in the status line above the input entry.
Multiple commands (`history') can be shown at the same time by the
.B -h
option or toggled at runtime by
.LR "^x h"
or by clicking the
.LR `h' .
When enabled, commands and statuses (in the colors mentioned earlier) are shown.

.SH COMMANDS
Normal commands can be started by typing them at the input entry and hitting return.
Several convenient keyboard shortcuts have been implemented, most starting with
.LR ^x
(control-x).
An
.L x
is displayed in the status line when
.LR ^x
has been pressed and the next character will be part of a
.LR ^x -command.

.TP
.BI "Page up" " and " "page down"

.TP
.LR "^x f"
Compactly display most files in the file tree.
.TP
.LR "^x d"

.SH INPUT
The input entry accepts most standard Inferno Tk bindings, but also has an vi-like editing mode inspired by
.L "set -o vi"
found in various korn shells.
The modification and motion commands described below are supported.
 Many accept numeric repeat modifiers.
Details can be found in external vi documentation, or the source.
Command mode (as opposed to insert mode) is indicated by a
.L [
in the status line.
.TP
.BR [iIaA]
Change to insert mode.
.TP
.BR [sSC] " and " cc " or " c<motion>
Substitute (delete text and change to insert mode).
.TP
.BR r<char>
Replace character under cursor by
.IR char .
.TP
.BR Y " or " yy " or " y<motion>
Yank text to the internal buffer.
.TP
.BR p " or " P
Paste text from the internal buffer.
The internal buffer is set by the yank command and to text deleted by modification commands.
.TP
.BR .
Repeat previous command (insertions cannot be repeated).
.TP
.BR u " and " ^r
Undo and redo changes, multiple levels implemented.
.TP
.BR j " and " k
Navigate through input entry history.
Only commands (not input for running commands) are stored in history.
.TP
.BR <repeat>G " or " <repeat>gg
Jump to the input entry with the given sequence number.
.TP
.BR D " or " dd " or " d<motion>
Delete text.
.TP
.BR x " or " X
Delete character under or before cursor.

.PP
The remainder are motion commands, they only change the cursor and can act as modifiers for modification commands.
.TP
.BR ^
To first non-blank of line.
.TP
.BR 0
To first character of line.
.TP
.BR $
To last cursor position of line.
.TP
.BR [wWeEbB]
Navigate words.
.LR [wWeE]

.LR [bB]
backward.
.LR [wW]
stop before a new word,
.LR [eE]

.TP
.BR h

.IR repeat .
.TP
.BR %
Jump to matching closing or opening character, one of
.LR [{(]}) ,
taking nesting into account.

.SH MOUSE
Chording works in the text areas and the input entry.
Chording in the input entry switches to insert mode and records the input entry text before the chord, for undo/redo.
Plumbing with button3 is supported too.
The selection or word under the mouse release is plumbed, taking off a trailing colon (from separating file names with line numbers from an error message) when an initial plumb message did not find a destination.
.PP
If the path to be plumbed is a directory, the command
.L "cd $dir && lc"
is executed instead.
If a command is already running, that command is started in a new instance of
.IR wm/run .
